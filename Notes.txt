This will be the source of truth. 

Add your concerns as a card under the backlog column.
Then anyone can pick a card and do it when they have time. It also captures the history.

Yey! we are going agile. ;-)


Hi Indika,
In the root directory​ of the project,​ issue the command
rake db:create
This will create a new database with sample data.​ No need to dump and import.
The schema and seeds are under the directory db if you want to further investigate.
Let me know how you go.
​


Hi Kaw,

Have fixed the db problem and was able to proceed. But i think you need to send us some environment variables and was waiting until u return to Melbourne :)..

Here is what I've done.

1) was complaining about secret_key_base. Have added the following line to development.rb and set the environment variable.
config.secret_key_base = ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"]
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=GENERATED_CODE

2) Change the database to sqlite3 in database.yml and rake db:create. fixed the db problem.
3) omini auth fails. i think we need to set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID environment variable.

There was also a problem with bootstrap, but i temporarily disabled bootstrap functionality.

Cheers,
Indika


Oh Yes.
Totally forgot to send those, but hey, you should've asked me earlier. :-)
Here are the secrets for the app. 
DO NOT share these with anyone or commit to github. Simply export the variables to your terminal when you run the server. 
in env.sh

Why do you want to switch to sqlite? Use mysql as I've configured. That's what we need to use in production. Usually sqlite is for testing/demo.
